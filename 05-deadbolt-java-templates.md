# Deadbolt Java Templates
Before you get your hopes up that Play templates can be written in Java, I'm talking about Scala templates rendered from Java controllers.

Using template constraints, you can exclude portions of templates from being generated on the server-side.  Template constraints have the same possibilities as controller constraints.

This is not a client-side DOM manipulation, but rather the exclusion of content when templates are rendered.  This also means that any logic inside the constrained content will not execute if authorization fails.

    @subjectPresent {
        <!-- paragraphs will not be rendered, satellites will not be repositioned and light speed will not be engaged if no subject is present -->
        <p>Let's see what this thing can do...</p>
        @repositionSatellite
        @engageLightSpeed
    }

One important thing to note here is that templates are blocking, so any Futures used need to be completed for the resuly to be used in the template constraints.  As a result, each constraint can take a function that expresses a Long, which is the millisecond value of the timeout.  It defaults to 1000 milliseconds, but you can change this globally by setting the `deadbolt.java.view-timeout` value in your `application.conf`.

### Handlers
By default, template constraints use the default Deadbolt handler, as obtained via `<YourDeadboltHandlerImpl>#get()` but as with controller constraints you can pass in a specific handler.  The cleanest way to do this is to pass the handler into the template and then pass it into the constraints.

### Fallback content
Each constraint has an `xOr` variant, which allows you to render content in place of the unauthorized content.  This takes the form `<constraint>Or`, for example `subjectPresentOr`

    @subjectPresentOr {
        <!-- paragraphs will not be rendered, satellites will not be repositioned and light speed will not be engaged if no subject is present -->
        <p>Let's see what this thing can do...</p>
        @repositionSatellite
        @engageLightSpeed
    } {
        <marquee>Sorry, you are not authorised to perform clich√©d actions from B movies.  Suffer the marquee!</marquee>
    }

In each case, the fallback content is defined as a second `Content` block following the primary body.

## SubjectPresent
Sometimes, you don't need fine-grained checked - you just need to see if there **is a** user present

##### Example 1
The default Deadbolt handler is used to obtain the subject.

    @subjectPresent() {
        This content will be present if handler#getSubject results in a Some
    }

    @subjectPresentOr() {
        This content will be present if handler#getSubject results in a Some
    } {
    	fallback content
    }

##### Example 2
A specific Deadbolt handler is used to obtain the subject.

    @(handler: DeadboltHandler)
    @subjectPresent(handler = handler) {
        This content will be present if handler#getSubject results in a Some
    }

    @subjectPresentOr(handler = handler) {
        This content will be present if handler#getSubject results in a Some
    } {
    	fallback content
    }

## SubjectNotPresent
Sometimes, you don't need fine-grained checked - you just need to see if there **is no** user present

##### Example 1
The default Deadbolt handler is used to obtain the subject.

    @subjectNotPresent() {
        This content will be present if handler#getSubject results in a None
    }

    @subjectNotPresentOr() {
        This content will be present if handler#getSubject results in a None
    } {
    	fallback content
    }

##### Example 2
A specific Deadbolt handler is used to obtain the subject.

    @(handler: DeadboltHandler)
    @subjectNotPresent(handler = handler) {
        This content will be present if handler#getSubject results in a None
    }

    @subjectNotPresentOr(handler = handler) {
        This content will be present if handler#getSubject results in a None
    } {
    	fallback content
    }

## Restrict
Use `Subject`s `Role`s to perform AND/OR/NOT checks.  The values given to the builder must match the `Role.name` of the subject's roles.

`la` and `as` are convenience functions for creating a `List<Array<String>>` and an `Array<String>`.  You can import both of them using

    @import be.objectify.deadbolt.core.utils.TemplateUtils.{la, as}

##### Example 1
The subject is obtained from the default handler, and must have the foo role.

    @restrict(roles = la(as("foo"))) {
        Subject requires the foo role for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 2
The subject is obtained from the default handler, and must have the foo AND bar role.

    @restrict(roles = la(as("foo", "bar")) {
         Subject requires the foo AND bar roles for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 3
The subject is obtained from the default handler, and must have the foo OR bar role.

    @restrict(roles = la(as("foo"), as("bar"))) {
         Subject requires the foo OR bar role for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 4
The subject is obtained from the default handler, and must have the foo AND bar role; otherwise, fallback content will be rendered.

    @restrictOr(roles = la(as("foo", "bar"))) {
         Subject requires the foo AND bar roles for this to be visible
    } {
    	Subject does not have the necessary roles
    }

##### Example 5
The subject is obtained from a specific handler, and must have the foo OR bar role.

    @(handler: DeadboltHandler)
    @restrict(roles = la(as("foo"), as("bar")), handler = handler) {
         Subject requires the foo OR bar role for this to be visible
    }


## Pattern
Use the `Subject`s `Permission`s to perform a variety of checks.

The default pattern type is `PatternType.EQUALITY`.

##### Example 1
The subject and `DynamicResourceHandler` are obtained from the default handler, and must have a permission with the exact value "admin.printer".

    @pattern(value = "admin.printer") {
        Subject must have a permission with the exact value "admin.printer" for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 2
The subject and `DynamicResourceHandler` are obtained from the default handler, and must have a permission that matches the specified regular expression.

    @pattern(value = "(.)*\.printer", patternType = PatternType.REGEX) {
    	Subject must have a permission that matches the regular expression (without quotes) "(.)*\.printer" for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 3
The `DynamicResourceHandler` is obtained from the default handler and used to apply the custom test

    @pattern(value = "something arbitrary", patternType = PatternType.CUSTOM) {
    	DynamicResourceHandler#checkPermission must result in true for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 4
The subject and `DynamicResourceHandler` are obtained from a specific handler, and must have a permission that matches the specified regular expression.

    @(handler: DeadboltHandler)
    @pattern(handler = handler, value = "(.)*\.printer", patternType = PatternType.REGEX) {
    	Subject must have a permission that matches the regular expression (without quotes) "(.)*\.printer" for this to be visible
    }

## Dynamic
The most flexible constraint - this is a completely user-defined constraint that uses `DynamicResourceHandler#isAllowed` to determine access.

##### Example 1
The `DynamicResourceHandler` is obtained from the default handler and is used to apply a named constraint to the content.

    @dynamic(name = "someName") {
        DynamicResourceHandler#isAllowed must result in true for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 2
The `DynamicResourceHandler` is obtained from the default handler and is used to apply a named constraint to the content with some hard-coded meta data.

    @dynamic(name = "someName", meta = "foo") {
        DynamicResourceHandler#isAllowed must result in true for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 3
The `DynamicResourceHandler` is obtained from the default handler and is used to apply a named constraint to the content with some dynamically-defined meta data.

    @(someMetaValue: String)
    @dynamic(name = "someName", meta = someMetaValue) {
        DynamicResourceHandler#isAllowed must result in true for this to be visible
    }

##### Example 4
The `DynamicResourceHandler` is obtained from a specific handler and is used to apply a named constraint.

    @(handler: DeadboltHandler)
    @dynamic(handler = handler, name = "someName") {
        DynamicResourceHandler#isAllowed must result in true for this to be visible
    }

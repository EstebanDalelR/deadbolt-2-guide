## About the author ##
Steve Chaloner has been a software developer, consultant and mentor since 1999.   He specialises in Java, but believes in using the right tool for the job. The right tool for him, for web-based applications at least, is the Play! framework, which is rocking his world.

He is the author of several open-source projects, the most successful of which is Deadbolt, an authorization system for Play!

In 2011, he was selected as one of the Expert Reviewers for the Play! Framework Cookbook, along with the creator of Play! and one of its oldest contributors.  At the moment of writing this, he is also one of the expert reviewers for two upcoming books on Play 2 from Manning, and another book on Play 2 from Packt.

In 2012, Steve co-founded the Belgian Play! Framework User Group with Ben Verbeken.

## Just in case you were wondering... ##
Yes, I pretty much ripped off this whole section from The Little Mongo Book (<https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-mongodb-book>).

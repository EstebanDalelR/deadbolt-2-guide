# Using Deadbolt 2 with Play 2 Scala projects #
Here's a curious fact.  Deadbolt 2 Scala has equivalent capabilities to Deadbolt 2 Java, but with less code and fewer actions.  Specifically, there are the same number of template tags,  but quite a few fewer actions.  Play 2 for Scala uses action composition in place of annotation-driven interceptors, and so there are no controller-level constraints.  As a result, there is no need for the equivalents of `@DeadboltDeferred`, `@BeforeAccess` or `@Unrestricted`.  These represent 33% of the interceptors of D2 Java.

# Introduction #
At the date of writing this, the small code experiment that turned into Deadbolt is just over two years old.  In that time, it has grown in capabilities, power and - hopefully - usefulness.  It has certainly reached the point where a few badly-written lines of text can adequately cover its features and use.  Once I factored in that it now has support for Java and Scala, and that its new architecture allows for easy extension with other languages, it became clear that a short booklet (or booklet-like document) was required.

I hope this document (booklet-like or otherwise) will prove useful as you integrate Deadbolt 2 (also known as D2, because I'm tired of constantly writing Deadbolt 2) into your application.

## History ##
Back in September 2010, I was embarking on my first project using the Play! Framework (version 1.03.2 for fans of unnecessary detail) and discovering the Secure module it shipped with was unsuitable for the required authorisation.  As a result, Deadbolt 1.0 was written to provide AND/OR/NOT support for roles.  Sometime later, dynamic rule support was added and other new features would be released as use cases and bug reports cropped up.

The user guide for Deadbolt 1 - which I can still highly recommend if you need authorisation support in your Play 1 apps - starts with this:

> Deadbolt is an authorisation mechanism for defining access rights to certain controller methods or parts of a view using a simple AND/OR/NOT syntax. It is based on the 
> original Secure module that comes with the Play! framework.
> 
> Note that Deadbolt doesnâ€™t provide authentication! You can still use the existing Secure module alongside Deadbolt to provide authentication, and in cases where 
> authentication is handled outside your app you can just hook up the authorisation mechanism to whatever auth system is used.

How much of this still holds true for Deadbolt 2?  More than 50% and less than 100%, give or take. 

* Deadbolt is still used for authorisation
* It can control access to controllers
* It can control access to templates
* The capabilities have expanded beyond the original role-based static checks
* Deadbolt 2 is based on Deadbolt 1, so it's related to the old Secure module in spirit, if not in implementation
* You can (or should be able to) combine Deadbolt 2 with any authentication system

Deadbolt 2 v1.0 was released at roughly the same time as Play 2.0, and was essentially the logic of Deadbolt 1 exposed in the Play 2 style.  Nine months after that initial release - nine months, I should add, of woefully inadequate Scala support - I re-designed the architecture to a more modular approach, and made a few small changes to the API to remove anachronistic elements.  The result is Deadbolt 2 2.0, or Deadbolt 2.0.

There is now a core module written in Java, and separate idiomatic modules for Java and Scala.  This is slightly different to the architecture of Play 2 itself, where the core and the Scala API are co-located.

## Java versus Scala ##
I have tried my best, within the constraints of both languages and my knowledge of them, to give equal capabilities to each version of Deadbolt 2.  Scala is generally detailed after Java in this book for two reasons.  The first reason is the alphabet.  The second is that by writing the Scala section last, I have a chance to increase my knowledge of a language that is frequently beautiful and occasionally a little bit like an ice-cream headache.

## Installing Deadbolt 2 ##
Deadbolt 2 is available from my GitHub-hosted Ivy repository.  You can make your application aware of this repository by updating your `project/Build.scala` file and adding the following line(s) to your `play.Project` object:

    val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
      resolvers += Resolver.url("Objectify Play Repository", url("http://schaloner.github.com/releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns),
      resolvers += Resolver.url("Objectify Play Snapshot Repository", url("http://schaloner.github.com/snapshots/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
    )

You only need to add both lines if you're switching between release and snapshot versions of Deadbolt.  If you only need a release OR a snapshot version, you can remove the unused repository declaration.

Once you have the repository declaration in place, you need to declare a dependency in `project/Build.scala`.  The version used here is 2.0-SNAPSHOT, but this can and will change when 2.0 becomes release version.

For the Java version of Deadbolt 2, use

    val appDependencies = Seq(
      "be.objectify" %% "deadbolt-java" % "2.0-SNAPSHOT"
    )

For the Scala version of Deadbolt 2, use

    val appDependencies = Seq(
      "be.objectify" %% "deadbolt-scala" % "2.0-SNAPSHOT"
    )

Both modules will pull in the `deadbolt-core` transitive dependency. 

## Migration notes ##
As mentioned above, some changes were made to the 2.0 API.  These should be straightforward to implement, as they are all in the form of either name changes, or package changes.

* `RoleHolder` is now `Subject` - as a name, `RoleHolder` made sense when Deadbolt could _only_ deal with roles.
* `DeadboltHandler#getRoleHolder` is now `DeadboltHandler#getSubject` - a reasonable consequence of the previous change
* `Role#getRoleName` is now `Role#getName` - the *Role* in get*Role*Name is superfluous, given the interface it is in
* Members of the `deadbolt-core` module now have the package name `be.objectify.deadbolt.core`
* Members of the `deadbolt-java` module now have the package name `be.objectify.deadbolt.java`
* Members of the `deadbolt-scala` module now have the package name `be.objectify.deadbolt.scala`

## Thanks ##
&lt;touchyFeely&gt;

I'd like to thank Guilluame Bort for introducing Play! in the first place, and all the people who have developed, patched and improved it ever since.

I would also like to thank everyone that tried Deadbolt, asked for features and reported or patched bugs.  All of you have helped me to improve it.  Your constant, irritating requests and badgering questions have made Deadbolt what it is today.

Finally, and always, to Greet and Lotte.

&lt;/touchyFeely&gt;

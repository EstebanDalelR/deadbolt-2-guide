# Java controller constraints #
If you like annotations in Java code, you're in for a treat.  If you don't, this may be a good time to consider the Scala version.

One very important point to bear in mind is the order in which Play! 2 evaluates annotations.  Annotations applied to a method are applied to annotations applied to a class.  This can lead to situations where D2 method constraints deny access because information from a class constraint.  See the section on deferring method-level interceptors for a solution to this.

As with previous chapter, here is a a breakdown of all the Java annotation-driven interceptors available in D2 Java, with parameters, usages and tips and tricks.

## Static constraints ##
Static constraints, such as Restrict, are implemented entirely within D2 because it can finds all the information needed to determine authorisation automatically.  For example, if a constraint requires two roles, "foo" and "bar" to be present, the logic behind the Restrict constraint knows it just needs to check the roles of the current roles holder.

#### SubjectPresent ####
`SubjectPresent` is one of the simplest constraints offered by D2.  It checks if there is a subject present, by invoking `DeadboltHandler#getSubject` and allows access if the result is not null.

##### Scope #####
`@SubjectPresent` can be used at the class or method level.

##### Parameters #####

|                         |                                  | in the response.  This value will be passed      |
|                         |                                  | to `DeadboltHandler#onAccessFailure`.   The      |
|                         |                                  | value of this parameter is completely arbitrary. |

|                         |                                  | in place of the default one.                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| deferred                | Boolean                          | If true, the interceptor will not be applied     |
|                         |                                  | until a DeadboltDeferred annotation is           |
|                         |                                  | encountered.                                     |

##### Example uses #####
1. Deny access to any method of a controller unless there is a user present.

    @SubjectPresent
    public class MyController extends Controller {

        public static Result index() {
            // this method will not be invoked unless there is a subject present.
            ...
        }

        public static Result search() {
            // this method will not be invoked unless there is a subject present.
            ...
        }
    }

2. Deny access to a single method of a controller unless there is a user present.

    public class MyController extends Controller {

        public static Result index() {
            // this method is accessible to anyone.
            ...
        }

        @SubjectPresent
        public static Result search() {
            // this method will not be invoked unless there is a subject present.
            ...
        }
    }

#### SubjectNotPresent ####
`SubjectNotPresent` is the opposite in functionality of `SubjectPresent`.  It checks if there is a subject present, by invoking `DeadboltHandler#getSubject` and allows access only if the result is null.

##### Scope #####
`@SubjectNotPresent` can be used at the class or method level.

##### Parameters #####

## Deferring method-level annotation-driven interceptors ##
Play 2 executes method-level annotations before controller-level annotations. This can cause issues when, for example, you want a particular action to be applied for method and before the method annotations. A good example is `Security.Authenticated(Secured.class)`, which sets a userâ€™s user name for `request().username()`. Combining this with method-level annotations that require a user would fail, because the user would not be present at the time the method interceptor is invoked.

One way around this is to apply `Security.Authenticated` on every method, which violates DRY and causes bloat.

    public class DeferredController extends Controller {

        @Security.Authenticated(Secured.class)
        @Restrict(value="admin")
        public static Result someAdminFunction() {
            return ok(accessOk.render());
        }

        @Security.Authenticated(Secured.class)
        @Restrict(value="editor")
        public static Result someEditorFunction() {
            return ok(accessOk.render());
        }
    }

A better way is to set the `deferred` parameter of the D2 annotation to `true`, and then use `@DeferredDeadbolt` at the controller level to execute the method-level annotations at controller-annotation time. Since annotations are processed in order of declaration, you can specify `@DeferredDeadbolt` after `@Security.Authenticated` and so achieve the desired effect.

    @Security.Authenticated(Secured.class)
    @DeferredDeadbolt
    public class DeferredController extends Controller {

        @Restrict(value="admin", deferred=true)
        public static Result someAdminFunction() {
            return ok(accessOk.render());
        }

        @Restrict(value="admin", deferred=true)
        public static Result someAdminFunction() {
            return ok(accessOk.render());
        }
    }

Specifying a controller-level restriction as deferred will work, if the annotation is higher in the annotation list than `@DeferredDeadbolt` annotation, but this is essentially pointless.  If your constraint is already at the class level, there's no need to defer it.  Just ensure it appears below any other annotations you wish to have processed first.

## Invoking DeadboltHandler#beforeAuthCheck independently ##
`DeadboltHandler#beforeAuthCheck` is invoked by each interceptor prior to running the actual constraint tests.  If the method call returns null, the constraint is applied, otherwise the result is returned.  The same logic can be invoked independently, using the `@BeforeAccess` annotation, in which case the call to `beforeRoleCheck` itself becomes the constraint.  Or, to say it in code, 

    if (deadboltHandler.beforeAuthCheck(ctx) == null)
    {
        result = delegate.call(ctx);
    }

##### Scope #####
`@BeforeAccess` can be used at the class or method level.

## Customising the inputs of annotation-driven actions ##
One of the problems with D2's annotations is they require strings to specify, for example, role names or pattern values.  It would be far safer to use enums, but this is not possible for a module - it would completely kill the generic applicability of the annotations.  If D2 shipped with an enum containing roles, how would you extend it?  You would be stuck with whatever was specified, or forced to fork the codebase and customise it.  Similarly, annotations can neither implement, extend or be extended.

To address this situation, D2 has four constraints whose inputs can be customised to some degree.  The trick lies, not with inheritence, but delegation and wrapping.  The constraints are

 * Restrict
 * Restrictions
 * Dynamic
 * Pattern

Here, I'll explain how to customise the Restrict constraint to use enums as annotation parameters, but the principle is the same for each constraint.

To start, create an enum that represents your roles.

    public enum MyRoles implements Role {
        foo,
        bar,
        hurdy;

        @Override
        public String getRoleName() {
            return name();
        }
    }

Next, create a new annotation to drive your custom version of Restrict.  Note that an array of `MyRoles` values can be placed in the annotation.  The standard `Restrict` annotation is also present to provide further configuration.  This means your customisations are minimised. 

    @With(CustomRestrictAction.class)
    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
    @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
    @Documented
    @Inherited
    public @interface CustomRestrict {
        MyRoles[] value();

        Restrict config();
    }

The code above contains `@With(CustomRestrictAction.class)` in order to specify the action that should be triggered by the annotation.  This action can be implemented as follows. 

    @Override
    public Result call(Http.Context context) throws Throwable {

        final CustomRestrict outerConfig = configuration;
        RestrictAction restrictAction = new RestrictAction(configuration.config(),
                                                           this.delegate)
        {
            @Override
            public String[] getRoleNames()
            {
                List<String> roleNames = new ArrayList<String>();
                for (MyRoles role : outerConfig.value())
                {
                    roleNames.add(role.getRoleName());
                }
                return roleNames.toArray(new String[roleNames.size()]);
            }
        };
        return restrictAction.call(context);
    }

Pretty simple stuff - the code is basically converting an array of enum values to an array of strings.

To use your custom annotation, you apply it as you would any other D2 annotation.

    @CustomRestrict(value = {MyRoles.foo, MyRoles.bar}, config = @Restrict(""))
    public static Result customRestrictOne() {
        return ok(accessOk.render());
    }

Each customisable action has one or more extension points.  These are

|Action class       |Extension points                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
|RestrictAction     | * String[] getRoleNames()        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
|RestrictionsAction | * List<String[]> getRoleGroups() |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
|Dynamic            | * String getValue()              |
|                   | * String getMeta()               | 
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
|Pattern            | * String getValue()              |
